              Before it burned to the ground, the structure</span> filled a small beach
            inlet below the Cliff House, also owned by Adolph Sutro at the time.
            Shortly after closing, a fire in 1966 destroyed the building
            while it was in the process of being demolished. All that remains
            of the site are concrete walls, blocked off stairs and
            passageways, and a tunnel with a deep crevice in the middle. The
            cause of the fire was arson. Shortly afterwards, the developer
            left San Francisco and claimed insurance money.

            During low tides, a powerful turbine water pump,
            built inside a cave at sea level, could be switched on from a control
            room and could fill the tanks at a rate of 6,000 US gallons a minute,
            recycling all the water in five hours.
